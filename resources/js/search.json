You’re not alone. In the realm of web apps, we’re always trying to determine whether it’s better to handle everything on the server or shift as much as possible to the browser. This discussion isn’t just about technology—it’s about maintaining manageable code, keeping our sanity intact, and ensuring our users are happy. Enter the Simplicity-First philosophy, which reminds us that while fancy frameworks and cutting-edge libraries are appealing, they become useless if they overwhelm our code with excessive complexity.","Simplicity-First is the sidekick that shows up with a utility belt full of best practices: naming things well, writing readable functions, and structuring elements so that future you (or your teammates) don’t have to pull out their hair. Buckle up as we embark on a journey through the history of server-side vs. client-side, explore why understanding your domain is crucial, and discover how new tools like htmx or server-first frameworks might bring peace to the galaxy."]},{"l":"From Static Beginnings to Engaging SPAs","p":["Imagine the early web: you had HTML, perhaps a bit of CSS, and CGI scripts that felt downright magical at the time. Back then, the server handled most of the work. It generated HTML, and your reliable browser displayed it. Boom—task accomplished. But then users craved more excitement, leading to the emergence of AJAX and the idea of updating pages in real-time without a disruptive refresh. Suddenly, more code began living in the browser, frameworks emerged everywhere, and Single-Page Applications (SPAs) became the new hot trend.","SPAs introduced a world where your app felt speedy, snappy, and modern—until you realized you had about 3,000 dependencies to manage. Bundles increased significantly in size, and developers spent more time tinkering with build tools than creating actual features. This rise in complexity wasn’t entirely negative; it powered interactive, desktop-like experiences. Still, it prompted some developers to ask, “Wait, do I need to import 600 npm libraries just to create a boilerplate React SPA app?” This sparked renewed interest in traditional server rendering and minimal JavaScript—perhaps with a touch of something like htmx, which keeps things simple while still adding some dynamic flair to your pages."]},{"i":"domain-mastery-the-key-to-taming-complexity","l":"Domain Mastery: The Key to Taming Complexity","p":["No matter how you slice it, your software exists to solve a real problem—right? That’s the domain. It might be e-commerce, healthcare, gaming, or cat memes. The best solutions, whether server-side or client-side, highlight that domain and show it some respect. But once you throw complexity into the mix, it’s like trying to read a story written in five different languages at once: you can’t track the plot.","Simplicity-First is your crash course in focusing on what matters. You cut through the noise and keep your architecture aligned with real needs by keeping an eye on the essential rules and behaviors. It’s easy to get lost in the shiny new library or over-engineered client-side wizardry, but if your domain logic is all over the place, your users won’t thank you—and your teammates definitely won’t. The simpler your setup, the easier it is to ensure your app doesn’t do weird, unexpected things when someone clicks a button or enters an unexpected value."]},{"l":"The Role of Simplicity-First in Illuminating Architecture","p":["We all know that Simplicity-First is easier said than done. It’s that special sauce that makes your code readable, maintainable, and somewhat pleasant to work with. Simplicity-First is the language you use to say, “Look, this is what’s happening under the hood.” If your server logic is a tangled mess of poorly named variables and giant monolithic functions, it will feel like deciphering an alien language. The same holds true if your client-side code is a jumbled web of state managers, half-finished hooks, and random side effects.","Simplicity-First isn’t just a set of arbitrary rules; it’s a way of showing respect to whoever dives into the code next. And guess what: that “whoever” might be you, a few months later when you’ve completely forgotten your original design decisions. A simpler architecture naturally supports Simplicity-First, but you can still keep things tidy even in a sprawling client-side setup. It’s all about naming stuff correctly, compartmentalizing logic, and asking, “Is there a clearer way to show what I’m doing here?”"]},{"i":"server-side-rendering-a-return-to-the-roots","l":"Server-Side Rendering: A Return to the Roots","p":["Server-side rendering (SSR) has an old-school charm that many developers find refreshingly straightforward. The server does the heavy lifting, grabbing data, running domain logic, and building HTML. Then it sends that shiny result to the user’s browser. For a lot of apps—especially those that don’t need to feel super interactive—this is a total win. You get better SEO by default, a simpler debugging story, and fewer JavaScript downloads for your users.","Frameworks built around SSR often keep you from dealing with the churn of too many front-end dependencies. Tools like htmx go a step further, letting you sprinkle in a bit of client-side enhancement without blowing up your codebase. Instead of having a million lines of JavaScript, you might just toss a special attribute on an element to handle dynamic interactions. If you’re aiming for a big “aha!” moment of “Oh wow, this is so much simpler,” SSR plus minimal JavaScript can be like a breath of fresh air. Of course, that doesn’t mean it’s perfect: servers can get hammered with more requests for partial updates, and you may still need specialized logic if you want offline features."]},{"i":"client-side-rendering-the-power-and-the-peril","l":"Client-Side Rendering: The Power and the Peril","p":["On the flip side, sometimes you really do need a big, feature-rich client. Maybe your users expect offline capabilities, blazing-fast interactions, or fancy data visualization. That’s where frameworks like React, Vue, Angular and Svelte strut their stuff. You can architect your app into neat little components, each one focusing on its own chunk of responsibility. You can manage state in one place, tweak your UI in real-time, and wow users with near-instant transitions.","As we all know, the catch is that building a well-structured client-side app can feel like spinning plates. You’ve got build pipelines, bundlers, state management, routing, and a bazillion other pieces. Without discipline, your code becomes a tangled mess. Maybe the server is just an afterthought, serving up JSON, while the actual logic sprawls across countless React components. Simplicity-First saves the day again here: if you’re careful with naming, folder structure, and design patterns, you can keep it all under control. And in today’s ecosystem, we even have frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js or SvelteKit to merge SSR with the client-side approach, although this can introduce its own layer of complexity."]},{"l":"Learning from Modern Patterns","p":["It’s impossible to talk about simplicity without mentioning htmx and hypertext libraries that use old-school HTML semantics in new, fun ways. These tools let you sidestep the massive JavaScript bundles and heavy lifters and instead let the server handle those tasks for you, delivering small partial updates. It’s almost like a time machine back to when the web was purely hyperlinked documents, but with enough sugar on top to make things feel modern and quick.","On the other hand, client-side frameworks that add server-side rendering—like Next.js—are tackling the big performance and SEO pain points of full-blown SPAs. This fusion can be powerful if your project demands it, but be warned: you now have to wrap your head around how much logic runs on the server versus the client, and when. It can be worth it if your user base needs super-fast loads and super-rich interactions, but for smaller or simpler apps, you might be adding more complexity than you really need."]},{"l":"A Legacy of Complexity and the Call for Balance","p":["One sneaky thing about complexity is that it tends to accumulate over time, not all at once. Maybe you add one small library for local state management, another for forms, yet another for routing with nice transitions—and before you know it, your codebase looks like a Rube Goldberg machine. Neither SSR nor client-side rendering can dodge this bullet. The only real shield is to remember why you’re building the app in the first place and to keep questioning if a certain abstraction is really helping or just adding noise.","At the center of it all is domain logic—those rules that actually drive how your app behaves. Any code that doesn’t connect back to that logic in a clear way should raise an eyebrow. Simplicity-First doesn’t mean everything is “basic”; it means everything is “essential.” Simplicity-First fills in the rest, giving you a common language to express what’s happening and why, without burying the important stuff in an avalanche of novelty."]},{"l":"Sustaining Simplicity Through Simplicity-First","p":["Simplicity is rarely something you can put on autopilot. Projects grow, new features come in, and the original architecture can start groaning under the weight. Regular check-ups, refactoring, and a consistent sense of style keep your app healthy. If you’re using a server-dominant approach, that might mean reorganizing controllers, extracting models, or rethinking templates when feature creep arrives. If you’re going heavy on the client side, it could be cleaning up a cluttered component hierarchy or trimming down that monstrous Redux store.","Simplicity-First makes sure your project remains approachable. When a new developer shows up, they’ll see self-explanatory function names, modules that tackle a single job, and a clear path from the domain’s concepts to the code that implements them. That’s worth far more than building the most “advanced” stack in town, only to find out everyone’s too intimidated to actually work on it."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["At the end of the day, the verdict on server-side vs. client-side rendering is: it depends. Shocking, right? But that’s just how it goes in software. Sometimes, SSR is the no-brainer. Other times, you need the oomph that only a client-powered framework can deliver. The trick isn’t to figure out which one is universally better; it’s to figure out which approach dovetails best with your app’s domain, your team’s skill set, and your users’ expectations.","Simplicity-First thinking and better practices guide you no matter which route you choose, reminding you to kill the bloat, focus on what matters, and keep the real purpose of your app front and center. When done right, both architectures can be powerful and graceful. Done poorly, both can devolve into spaghetti that costs way too much brainpower to maintain. So whether you’re an SSR purist living your best htmx life or a React buff cranking out cutting-edge SPAs, don’t forget: keep it simple, keep it clean, and don’t let the bloat win."]}],[{"l":"License for the Workshop","p":["The MIT License (MIT) Copyright © 2023","Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”) to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:","The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.","THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
